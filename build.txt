1. move SCV towards depot build location at ~12 seconds
2. 14 supply + 100 minerals - build depot towards center from command center
3. 16 supply + ??? minerals - build barracks near depot + gas refinery
4. move units to gas refinery just before it finishes to get them mining immediately
5. 17 supply  - send SCV to scout enemy base (check for enemy expansion)
6. 19 supply + ??? minerals - orbital command on command center + first marine
7. 20 supply + ??? minerals - build second command center + set rally point (idk what this is)
8. when first marine finished - build reactor on the barracks + start second depot next to barracks
9. 22 supply + 100 gas - factory in between the 2 command centers
10. 23 supply + ??? minerals - build bunker towards the center of the map from the 2nd command center
11. once reactor from (8) finishes, build 2 more marines and move all marines in front of bunker
12. 26 supply + ??? minerals - build second refinery
13. once factory from (9) finishes, unlock star port + tech lab
14. use extra resources for marines (but prioritize buildings)
15. once factory upgrades finish, build widow mine for air unit defence
16. 36-38 supply - build depot behind minerals at the 2nd command center
17. when star port finishes - build viking for defence or liberator for attack
18. once widow mine finishes, start building a tank
19. once depot from (16) is done, build another depot right next to it, and continue this chain (build a depot whenever the one next to it finishes)

--- This is generally when the base building is established ---
--- From here on we focus on building an army to attack     ---

20. ~46 supply, build 2 more barracks next to the star port and factory
21. once the air unit finishes (17) build another tech lab
22. once the tank (18) finishes, move the factory to a tech lab and the star port to a reactor
23. ~4.5 mins, build an Eng Bay and a gas refinery next to the 2nd command center
24. when the factory is moved, build another tank and put the barracks (20) on the tech labs previously connected to the star port and factory
25. when the Eng Bay is done, upgrade infantry weapons level 2 and research stim on a tech lab
26. when mineral line is 16/16, make a second gas refinery

--- This is when the army production is well established ---
from here on, we use the barracks to make marines (later on marauders), tanks in the factory and medivacs in the star port
when we make marines, we want to begin them all at the same time, for teams of 3
tanks can be started right away, but hold out on the medivacs until combat shields finish

27. research combat shields
28. from here on, we build a command center and go through the upgrade tree
29. once a suitable number of upgrades have been researched, go for the attack
